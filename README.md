# transcriber-tool

I need an internal tool that lists a number of transcriptions. Each transcription has a name, a date (created), a size (in mb), and a summary of the transcription. 

These should have a status, success or failed. If failed it could be chatgpt4 failure or a trancription failure. 

I need to be able to re-run some of the transcirptions specially those that have 0mb which means they failed. 

Make sure you list 10 example transcirptions (some of them should be empty - 0mb)

Make it look modern and stylish.
